# Libraries & SDKs

API clients, SDKs, and utility libraries for prediction market integration.

## Purpose

Evaluate libraries we might use to build Antevorta:

- API clients for Polymarket and Kalshi
- Blockchain/Web3 utilities
- Data processing tools
- Useful open source components

## Polymarket

- **py-clob-client** - Official Python client for Polymarket CLOB API
- **dr-manhattan** - Alternative Polymarket library

## Kalshi

- **aiokalshi** - Async Python client for Kalshi API

## Data

- **predmarket** - Prediction market data aggregation

## Analysis Structure

Each library analysis should cover:

- **Overview**: What it does, who maintains it
- **API Coverage**: Which endpoints/features are supported
- **Code Quality**: Types, tests, documentation, maintenance activity
- **Integration Effort**: How easy to adopt, dependencies, gotchas
- **Verdict**: Use it, fork it, or build our own

## Reference Repositories

Libraries are cloned to `../../reference/` for direct inspection.
