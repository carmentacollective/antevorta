# The Name: Antevorta

## The Triple Meaning

**Antevorta** carries three meanings that converge perfectly for a prediction markets
trading system:

### The Goddess

Antevorta was a Roman goddess of the future—one of the Camenae, prophetic deities who
could see what was to come. She and her sister Postvorta were companions of Carmenta,
representing knowledge of future and past respectively.

Originally they were two aspects of a single goddess, "analogous to the two-headed
Janus"—one face looking forward, one looking back.

### The Etymology

From Latin:

- **ante** — "before"
- **vorta** — from _vertere_, "to turn" or "to change"

Antevorta literally means **"before the change"**—the moment before an outcome resolves,
before the future becomes the past.

This is the essence of prediction markets: positioning yourself _before the change_,
when uncertainty still exists and edge can be captured.

### The Bet

In gambling and trading, an **ante** is your stake—the money you put down before the
cards are dealt, the position you take before the outcome is known.

Every trade on Polymarket or Kalshi is an ante: a bet placed on what the future will
bring.

## The Convergence

A trading bot that analyzes prediction markets is, in essence, doing what the goddess
Antevorta did: looking forward, sensing what will come, and acting on that foresight.

We place our antes based on that vision.

The name captures both the divine aspiration (seeing the future) and the grounded
reality (putting money where our predictions are).

We build systems that embody Antevorta's gift: autonomous intelligence that sees
patterns humans miss, identifies inefficiencies before they close, and acts with the
speed that prediction markets demand.
